**AmericasNLP 2024 Shared Task 1: Machine Translation Systems for Indigenous Languages**

The idea of shared task 1 is to build translation systems between Indigenous languages of the Americas and a high-resource language.

*Task Format*. Each data split (train/dev/test) consists of two files per language pair: one with the source language and one with the target language. For test, initially we will only provide one file (with the source language). Within the files, each sentence has its own line; sentences that are on the same line in source and target are parallel.
