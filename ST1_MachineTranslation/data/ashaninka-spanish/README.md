## Parallel data

The parallel data provided for Ash√°ninka (cni) - Spanish (es) has been extracted and pre-processed by Richard Castro (https://github.com/hinantin/AshaninkaMT). He processed different sources and provided his own translations.

# TSV files
The HelsinkiNLP participation in the MT shared task in previous years included gathering additional resources. When available for each language-pair, these resources have been made available to participants in the `extra.tsv` and `synthetic.tsv` files.
Each `.tsv` document contains 3 columns, with a parallel sentence and its origin, as follows: 
```
TAG_of_sentence_origin    source_sentence    target_sentence  
```
Furhter, each files contents are:
 - `extra.tsv`: data obtained form different resources, as reported in De Gibert et al.[(2023)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.americasnlp-1.20/). The `TAG_of_sentence_origin` field roughly corresponds to the names used in the article.  
 - `synthetic.tsv`: data generatied via backtranslating resources
